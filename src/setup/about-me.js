        <p>I'm a creative developer with years of experience in building products and appealing web experiences. My gateway to front end development was my love of Art and Design â€” looking at it, studying it, and then creating it. The science surrounding human perception, communication, and creativity fascinates me to this day.
        <br /><br />
        As a front-end developer & designer, I've helped think tank experts build a web presence and hone their content, giving them an opportunity to connect with their audiences in clearer, more imaginative ways.
        <br /><br />
        I've lead the front end efforts of web projects large and small on topics such as financial services, non-profits and food services. Every new product is an exciting opportunity to mold complex analysis and data into a clear, compelling, and accessible form.
        <br /><br />
        I work closely with developers throughout these projects and collaborate with other members of a multidisciplinary team to produce code, graphics, data visualizations, and videos under a unified vision.</p>
